# Systems and Cloud Operations Engineer @ IDVerse

**Full time - Remote - USA**

Join a new team of passionate engineers and build a world-class platform to fight identity fraud at a global scale.

## The Position

You will work in close collaboration with our Head of DevOps, our engineering team and our product team to:

- Build and maintain our next-generation, secure and scalable infrastructure ;
- Evolve and maintain our current platform, and prepare for its migration ;
- Participate in our follow-the-sun support operations team.
- Help architect and build not only the systems, but also the DevOps team, tools, and processes ;

## Needed qualifications

Whilst technical competence is critical, we place great emphasis on passion, communication and collaboration across the business.

- Your passion for systems reliability, (AWS) Cloud Computing, Security and Elegant Architecture fuels your need to always learn more
- You have 3+ years of experience working with the main AWS products as well as the serverless ones
- You have 3+ years experience managing Linux/Unix based systems and LAMP-style stacks
- You're proficient with server configuration, monitoring, and maintenance in traditional environments
- You understand networking fundamentals, load balancing, and system security
- You have a strong background in automation and infrastructure as code (we use AWS CDK)
- You have outstanding communication skills--both in writing and orally--and collaborate effectively with a team
- You understand that documentation is half the battle
- You know it takes time to build anything correctly, and you also know how to "get things done" when the situation calls for it
- You are autonomous, but also know it's better to ask than to guess. You are dependable, responsible, and committed

More than any item we could list, we're looking for someone who digs deep into problems instead of applying quick fixes. The ideal candidate is naturally curious and won't stop until they truly understand how systems work. When they encounter something unfamiliar, they take the initiative to learn it. They ask thoughtful questions, collaborate with teammates to find answers, and genuinely enjoy expanding their technical knowledge. We value persistence and a passion for learning over someone who's content with surface-level understanding.

## About us

Identity empowers lives. Whether it's accessing financial services, securing digital communications, or opening online accounts, the modern digital world needs reliable identity verification.
At IDVerse, our purpose is to empower true identity for people around the world so that everyone can pursue the goals they are entitled to achieve. We pioneered the use of generative AI and synthetic media to train deep neural network systems with bias-tested AI, which protects against discrimination based on race, age, and gender. Through our advancements in the field of Natural Vision Processing (NVP), we're teaching machines to autonomously see and perceive like humans and excel in ways that people cannot.

The position is remote and the work week can be flexible.
Remuneration will be competitive and based on experience.
